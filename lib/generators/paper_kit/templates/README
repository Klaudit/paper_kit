Hooray, you just installed Paper Kit in your rails app!!

If you curious what the install generator done so far, actually, it created the
following layout, css and js files in your app:

  * app/views/layouts/_base.html.erb
  * app/assets/stylesheets/paper_kit.css
  * app/assets/javascripts/paper_kit.js

Also, it added require directive to require paper_kit.css and paper_kit.js from
following manifest files:

  * app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
  * app/assets/javascripts/application.js

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet

  * Ensure app/assets/stylesheets/paper_kit.css is loaded in application.css
    with `require_tree .` or `require paper_kit`.

  * Ensure `require paper_kit` has been added to
    app/assets/javascripts/application.js.

  * Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
    For example:

      root to: "home#index"

  * If you are deploying on Heroku with Rails 3.2 only, you may want to set:

      config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

    On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB or
    load models when precompiling your assets.
